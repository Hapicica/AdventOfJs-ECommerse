# Day 2 - eCommerce component - by Aniko Gardonyi

This challenge is from [Advent of JavaScript](https://www.adventofjs.com/) #adventofjs

You are able to:
- add meals to the cart
- change the amount of the meal in the card
- when the quantity becomes zero, the meal is deleted from the basket and can be added again
- you can see the total prices and the taxes

There is a JQuery and a Vanilla JS file attached to it<br>
Feel free to use the code of your project

(My goal was not to modify the original html file, so I did not use an html template)
